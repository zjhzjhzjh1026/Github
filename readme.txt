the code contain five main part:
part1 is to  merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. There are four steps: 
step 1 is to download zip file from website
step 2 is to unzip the data
step 3 is to load data into R
step 4 is to merge train and test data
part2 is to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. There are two steps.
step 1 is to load feature name into R
step 2 is to extract mean and standard deviation of each measurements
part3 is to use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. There are two steps.
step 1 is to load activity data into R
step 2 is to replace 1 to 6 with activity names
part 4 is to appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
part 5 is to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject( from the data set in step 4)
